Off the Coast you can see small islands named as first and second islands.Some travelers record their experience of walking across several small islets in the second island is buzzing with activity of fish, crabs and seagulls.And some other traveler identifies the island to be the playground for rare birds.You can also have a look at a popular tourist attraction near Adam’s Bridge called Dancing Islands. The chain of sprinkled islands here has sand dunes in which the sand keeps ‘shifting’ from one location to another. This creates the beautiful illusion of the sands constantly moving and dancing"

You can also meet pods of friendly Dolphins such as the Common dolphins, Bottlenose dolphins, Spinner dolphins, Risso’s dolphins and striped dolphins as they playfully somersault and dance on the ocean waves. There’s also a good chance of seeing flying fish, turtle, manta rays and even sharks. The best time to Whale watch is between November and April each year. Take back beautiful memories of the gentle giants of the ocean; it’s a once-in-lifetime experience! In the afternoon after cookery class, you are free to do your beach activities."
