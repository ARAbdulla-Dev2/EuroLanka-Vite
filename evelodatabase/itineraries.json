Culturally, it's an intriguing place: dotted with ancient baobab trees (native to Africa and said to have been planted by Arab merchants many centuries ago) and crumbling colonial edifices built by the Portuguese, Dutch and Brits.                                                                                                       Off the Coast you can see small islands named as first and second islands.Some travelers record their experience of walking across several small islets in the second island is buzzing with activity of fish, crabs and seagulls.And some other traveler identifies the island to be the playground for rare birds.You can also have a look at a popular tourist attraction near Adam’s Bridge called Dancing Islands. The chain of sprinkled islands here has sand dunes in which the sand keeps ‘shifting’ from one location to another. This creates the beautiful illusion of the sands constantly moving and dancing"
